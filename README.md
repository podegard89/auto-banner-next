As a contracted and remote STLCC employee, there were a couple of systems in which I needed to report hours. I created this project to automate this process.

From a single page, I can clock in, clock out, and input shift data into one of STLCC's online applications called "Banner" (hence the project name). 

### The tech stack:

Next.js
Puppeteer
Google Spreadsheet (database)

In the process of learning React, I sought a technology that would allow me write puppeteer scripts and a React-based UI in the same application. After creating multiple iterations of this project in React and attempting to host the puppeteer script as a serverless Google Cloud function, I found Next.js to be the perfect technology for my needs.

Goals:  
-Host the application with authentication  
-Implement Redux, React Context API, or some other state management tool
